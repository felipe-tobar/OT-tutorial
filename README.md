# A tutorial on Optimal Transport

This repository hosts the material for the tutorials on Optimal Transport that I have given since 2024,  including slides and Jupyter notebooks. The following tutorials are based on the material in this repo: 

- **22/09/24.** Optimal Transport for Signal Processing, *IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing*.  Given jointly with Laetitia Chapel, IRISA, Obelix team, Institut Agro Rennes-Angers. [Slides here ](https://github.com/felipe-tobar/OT-tutorial/blob/main/slides/talk_MLSP.pdf).

- **04/02/25.** Optimal Transport for Machine Learning and Data Analysis, *Imperial-X AI: Cutting-Edge Tutorial Series*. [Slides here ](https://github.com/felipe-tobar/OT-tutorial/blob/main/slides/talk_IX.pdf).

- **22/05/25.** A hands-on tutorial on Optimal Transport, *Machine Learning and Global Health Network*. [Slides here](https://github.com/felipe-tobar/OT-tutorial/blob/main/slides/talk_MLGH.pdf).
